# An Appendix for Today's Interview

I acknowledge that I couldn't solve the interview exercise in today's interview with MineKafon.

This is not an attempt of redeeming myself but instead for my own sake. I couldn't leave the task as it was with myself walking away.

Therefore I went home and solved the task again for closure. - No ChatGPT or any AI was used and it took me about 30 minutes.

Again Jessy - thank you for the chance and the patience. If it's ok with you I might try again in the future.

Best,
Lasse
